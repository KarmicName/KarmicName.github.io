	<h1>Created games collection</h1>
	<p>Okay, this list is pretty sad, as most of my games are in varying states of unfinished builds on my PC.</p>
	<p>For the time being, the only game on here is the game I made for My First Game Jam in Winter 2017.</p>
  <p>In addition, the game is unfinished. It was my first attempt at using Game Maker Studio, and it's a fairly functional skeleton.

  If you'd like more examples of my programming work, feel free to ask on Discord and I'll gladly oblige.
