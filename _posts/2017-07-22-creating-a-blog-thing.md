Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. 
It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.

Actually that last line was a lie, but hey learning is fun right? Also, Jekyll, more like Jerkyll.
