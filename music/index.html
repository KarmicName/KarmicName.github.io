	<h1>These are FamiTracker compositions.</h1>
	<p>I felt like I needed to get that out into the open.</p>
	<p>As it stands, I'm relatively inexperienced in the composition of musical themes, but I do know my way around a tracker.
    
  All of these pieces were my first attempts at tracker based compositional pieces with various bits of inspiration dragged from here and there.
  
  I would definitely like to improve my compositional skills in the future.</p>

    My first compositional piece. No real melody, just a basic beat and triangle wave. Not awful though.

    My second compositional piece, with an attempt at melody and harmony. Doesn't loop well.

    A more experimental composition I tried, and my third. It's special.

    The last piece I was working on. Show improvement, but it was unfinished.
